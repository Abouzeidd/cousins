        Soupe à l’oignon 
     </h1>
     <p>
        <b> This is a traditional French soup made of onions and beef stock, usually served with croutons and melted cheese on top.  The soup’s unique flavor comes from the caramelization of the onions, which often have brandy or sherry added during the slow-cooking process. </b>

        Chocolate soufflé 
    </h1>
    <p> <b> The rich yet lightweight dessert has been gracing French tables since the 18th century . The distinctive airy texture comes from separating the egg whites from the yolk and whipping them into a stiff meringue before folding them back into the chocolate batter. The baking time and cooking temperature is specific, and easy to get wrong, but the payoff is immediate , soufflés are served hot and fresh from the oven. </b>

        Crème brûlée 
    </h1>
    <p> <b> Every bite of a crème brûlée is an exercise in opposites. The sweet vanilla custard flavor contrasted with the almost bitter flavor of the bruléed topping; the crunch of the caramelized sugar against the smooth, creamy texture of the custard underneath; the gentle water bath used to bake the custard compared with the dramatic blowtorch flame used to melt the sugar ,in this dish opposites definitely attract. </b>

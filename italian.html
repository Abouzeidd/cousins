            Every pizza maker has their own secrets and every pizza, made of flour, water, yeast, and salt, can be stuffed or topped in many different ways.
            <br>
            The original pizza was created in southern Italy, at the end of the 18th century in honor of the Queen of Italy, Margherita di Savoia.

            <br>Creamy and rich in cheese, it is prepared with rice typical of northern areas. Among the most popular is “risotto alla milanese”, which is prepared with white wine, Parmesan cheese, butter, onions, and saffron, which gives it its unmistakable yellow color.
            <br> But it can also be made with many other ingredients such as pumpkin, red radicchio, mushrooms, sausage, or shellfish. </b>

            <br> Rome, however, became the capital of spaghetti, and where “spaghetti alla carbonara” made history. it was born almost by chance, from the imagination of a young cook, who added bacon with egg yolk, milk, cream, and cheese. <br>
            The recipe has changed little over the years and now includes bacon, egg yolk, and cheese. Another famous pasta dish is the “penne all’arrabbiata”—pasta with a spicy tomato sauce. </b>

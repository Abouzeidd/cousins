    <h1> Top 5 Traditional syrian Food To Try </h1>

    <br>

    <h2>1- Shawarma</h2>
    <Img src="https://media.istockphoto.com/id/1421688556/photo/beef-shawarma-on-a-dark-background-shawarma-with-beef-in-pita-bread.jpg?s=612x612&w=0&k=20&c=wAhnmKwTKhukglXVPQBR2FI0w4h07mwpgz0QSTY99e0=" width="500">
    <p> Shawarma, popular street food in the Middle East, which originated in Turkey and is made of spit-roasted layers of lamb, beef, or other meat that are sliced and often wrapped in or served with pita.
         Shawarma is similar to Greek gyros, though the former is seasoned with more spices and the latter with more herbs.
          Hummus and tahini are commonly included.
           The yogurt sauce called tzatziki usually served with gyros is not served with shawarma.
            French fries often accompany both dishes. </p>
    
    <h2>2- Manakish</h2>
    <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/09/Zaatar_Mankousheh.jpg/375px-Zaatar_Mankousheh.jpg" width="500" height="300">
    <p>Manakish (Arabic: مناقيش, romanized: manāqīsh), or in singular form man'ousheh, or other spellings, is a popular Levantine food[1] consisting of dough topped with thyme, cheese, or ground meat. Similar to a pizza, it can be sliced or folded, and it can be served either for breakfast or lunch.

        Traditionally, women would bake dough in a communal oven in the morning, to provide their family with their daily bread needs, and would prepare smaller portions of dough with different toppings for breakfast at this time.[2]
        
        Manakish are popular across the Levant,[3][4] and can also be found in neighboring regions, and centers of Levantine emigration.</p>

    <h2>3- Al-maglouba</h2>
    <img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/V_bi7xZQI5A/maxresdefault.jpg" width="500" height="300">
    <p>Maqluba (or maqlooba, makloubeh, maqlouba - however you want to spell it!) is a famous middle eastern rice, vegetable and meat dish that will impress any guest. The unique thing about this dish is how it is carefully layered, cooked, then flipped upside down to reveal the delicious vegetables and meat. Don't be intimidated by how it looks, it's easy to execute. Many 5-star reviews later, this recipe is a reader favourite!

    <h2>4- kibbeh</h2>
    <img src="https://thefooddoctor.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/kibbeh-last.jpg?w=600" width="500" height="300">
    <p>Kibbeh, also known spelled kibbi or kebbeh, is a mixture of cracked wheat, beef, onions and spices made into many different dishes like these kibbeh balls version. This is similar to my Baked Kibbeh recipe, but instead of layering the ingredients in a baking dish, you shape them into what we grew up calling footballs!</p>

    <h2>5- Sheikh Al-Mahshi</h2>
    <img src="https://www.chefspencil.com/wp-content/uploads/Sheikh-Al-Mahshi-960x720.jpg.webp" width="500" height="300">
    <p>The main ingredient of Sheikh Al-Mahshi is zucchini, along with ground beef or chicken and yogurt. It has a unique flavor but takes a long time to prepare; you have to scrap out the zucchini first then fill it with meat and pine nuts. While it takes time, the taste makes it worth all the effort! It is everybody’s favorite lunch so you will always find in on the menu, especially in the holy month of Ramadan. Various types of accompaniments are served with it, particularly sour pickles and eggplant dip.</p>

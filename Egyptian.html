    <h1>Top 5 Traditional Egyptian Food To Try</h1>
    <br>
    <h2>1- Mahshi</h2>
        <img src="https://modo3.com/thumbs/fit630x300/103327/1596558777/%D8%B7%D8%B1%D9%8A%D9%82%D8%A9_%D8%B9%D9%85%D9%84_%D9%85%D8%AD%D8%B4%D9%8A_%D9%88%D8%B1%D9%82_%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B9%D9%86%D8%A8_%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D8%B5%D8%B1%D9%8A.jpg" width="500">
    
            <p>Mahshi is basically veggies stuffed with rice mixture. It has been always a rocket science for me, specially the stuffed grape leaves and cabbage rolls , as they require some skills in rolling them. But once you get the hang of it, you will stuff almost any veggies you like just give it a try and you will see for your self ... It is an addicting process</p>

    <h2>2- Kushari</h2>

            <p>Delicious Egyptian Koshari is the national dish of Egypt.
             This interesting combo of carbs on carbs on carbs with all the fixings is delicious and the most favorite dish we had in Cairo.
              It’s  got spiced lentils, rice, vermicelli, pasta, chickpeas, topped with spicy tomato sauce and fried onions, SO GOOD!</p>

            <p>Mulukhiyah is a classic Middle Eastern dish, a delicious soupy vegetable dish made with Jew’s Mallow, a distinctive tasting leafy green.
         It’s cooked with chicken broth, and is utterly comforting.
        Mulukhiyah, also known as mulukhiya, mulukhia, or molokhia, or in Arabic ملوخية is a hallmark of Middle Eastern cuisine.</p>

        <img src="https://www.celebritycruises.com/blog/content/uploads/2022/05/egyptian-food-hero.jpg" width="500" >
        
            <p>Ful wa Ta’meya (Fava Beans and Falafel): Egypt
                Ful mudammas and Ta’meya are the original Egyptian fast food; they are a staple of the Egyptian diet.
                 The ful (pronounced: fool) is made of fava beans that are simmered all night in a massive round cauldron-looking pot called Qedra.
                  The ta’meya, or Egyptian falafel is made out of crushed fava beans that is later mixed and made into a paste then fried, unlike Lebanese falafel that is made out of hummus.
                    Perfect for vegetarians.</p>

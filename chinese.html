    <p> Dim sum is a traditional Chinese meal made up of small plates of dumplings and other snack dishes and is usually accompanied by tea. Similar to the way that the Spanish eat tapas, the dishes are shared among family and friends. Typically dim sum is consumed during brunch hours late morning to lunchtime. </p> <br>

    <p> A wonton is to China what ravioli is to Italy: a widely recognized food that is enjoyed by many people in numerous ways. Every day, countless bowls of wonton soup are served around the world. This soup is popular enough that it has resulted in widespread availability, from steaming bowls on street carts in Asia, to appearing on menus in Chinese restaurants, to even grocery supermarkets where canned versions are stocked on shelves.</p> <br>

    <P> Douhua, or tofu pudding, is a type of fresh, extra-soft, uncurdled tofu that is even softer than silken tofu. It is so soft that it’s often served with a ladle. In northern China, we call it Dou Fu Nao (directly translated, means “tofu brain”) and we serve it with a savory gravy. In southern China, people usually call it douhua and serve it with a gingery syrup. While traveling to central and western China, I’ve had the dish served with various savory sauces (usually soy sauce based) with fresh aromatics, pickles, and chili oil.</P> <br>
